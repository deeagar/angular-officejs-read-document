# Read and Open new Word Document

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.

Reads the entire .docx document with the Office.js library and gets the complete document in base64 encoded string. You can then either send the complete document to server for further processing. Here, I've just read the bytes and opened a new word document with it just to prove the concept.

Motivation for this - 

## Development server

Run `npm install` to download required node modules. 

Run `npm run start` to start dev server on `https://localhost:4200/`.

## Load the add-in
Sample manifest.xml attached to side-load add-in in Word.
